# B-Script
A language to replace your command prompt.

# Usage
Note that most of these things may not currently work.
## The show command
Basic show command:
```
show > text
```
The text that you use the show command on does not need to be in
quotation marks. You can also show variables, though we will get to
that later.

## Creating variables
```
var > name > value
```
## Showing variables
```
show > get > name
```
