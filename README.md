# B-Script
A language to replace your command prompt.

# Usage
Note that most of these things may not currently work.

## Functions
### The show command
Basic show command:
```
show > text
```
The text that you use the show command on does not need to be in
quotation marks. You can also show variables, though we will get to
that later.

### Creating variables
```
var > name > value
```
### Showing variables
```
show > get > name
```

## Type declaration
Unlike languages like python or javascript, B-Script doesn't figure
out what type something is by syntax clues. Instead, you need to
tell it.
To initiate a string, put an s at the beginning of it.
`var > mystring > sMy String`
To initiate an integer, use an i.
`var > myint > i123`
